## Purpose and Motivation

Air travel is an integral part of modern life, connecting people and businesses across the world. Flight aviation fans who enjoy visiting the different airports and checking the flights dream about having unforgettable experiences in an airport that is busy and contains various flights at a certain time! 

Since traveling is expensive so exploring the busiest airports at their busiest time will be time efficient and money-saving! Our proposed dashboard would be a reliable tool that can help fans who love airports and flights to embark on memorable adventures in a European airport by providing them with the information. The proposed dashboard is a one-stop shop for finding relevant information like the number of flights in every airport in a European country to find the busiest airport. The departure, arrival and the total number of flights in a country per month to find the busiest time. We aim to enable fans to take informed decisions on which airport they can find the most airplanes to visit.

Please read my detailed [`proposal.md`](https://github.com/eyrexh/EuroFly/blob/main/docs/proposal.md) to have a more general idea about how this dashboard can provide the solution for a specific scenario.

## Description

Our dashboard `EuroFly` provides users with interactive visualizations of flight data from various countries and airports. Users can select a year and a European country, and view the total number of flights for each airport in the selected country, as well as the monthly number of departures, arrival and total flights in all the airports for a selected country. The app aims to provide insights into global air travel patterns and trends, as well as serve as a tool for travel planning and research.

## Data

In this project, we are using the data collected from [Eurocontrol](https://ansperformance.eu/data/), including the data of flights information in Europe from January 1st, 2016 to May 5th, 2022. The dataset contains 688099 registers including daily number of departure flights, arrival flights and total number of flights for each airport in Europe.

The data set is public and can be found in [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-07-12). Follow this link to access to the source dataset [flights.csv](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-07-12/flights.csv).
