## Purpose and Motivation

Air travel is an integral part of modern life, connecting people and businesses across the world. With millions of flights taking off every day, understanding air travel trends is crucial for many industries, from tourism and hospitality to transportation and logistics.

This flight dashboard aims to provide insights into air travel trends by analyzing data from thousands of flights in European countries. By visualizing data on the number of flights and airports, users can gain a better understanding of how air travel has evolved over time and across different countries in Europe.

## Description

Our dashboard `EuroFly` provides users with interactive visualizations of flight data from various countries and airports. Users can select a year and a European country, and view the total number of flights for each airport in the selected country, as well as the monthly number of departures, arrival and total flights in all the airports for a selected country. The app aims to provide insights into global air travel patterns and trends, as well as serve as a tool for travel planning and research.
